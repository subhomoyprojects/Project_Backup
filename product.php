                    <div>
                        <p>All our knitted flat elastic is constructed from a series of rubber threads engulfed with yarns, such as cotton, polyester, nylon, or a blend of those materials. Latex rubber is commonly used in knitted flat elastic. </p>
                        <p>The combination of fiber content and construction plays the largest role in how much stretch the material provides, and helps determine which flat elastic material is best for the application at hand.It can be confusing when choosing the right type of flat elastic. Knitted elastic material is not going to narrow when it is stretched mostly because it does not have as much rubber or fiber in the product as a braided or woven elastic.Because it’s lightweight, it’s best-suited for lightweight fabrics, thus making it appropriate for most apparel items. It doesn’t narrow when stretched and is not affected by needle piercing, making it as suitable for direct fabric application as it is for casings.</p>
